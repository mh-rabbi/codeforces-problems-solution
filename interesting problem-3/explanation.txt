### Problem Breakdown:

This problem revolves around an important integer \( n \) that Dmitry accidentally wrote incorrectly. The number \( n \) was supposed to have the form
\( 10^x \times y \), but Dmitry missed the symbol '^' (exponentiation), meaning the result is a concatenation of numbers rather than exponentiation. 
The task is to determine which of the integers could have been the important integer \( n \) that Dmitry miswrote.

### Key Insights:

1. **Number Structure**: 
   - The correct form of \( n \) is supposed to be \( 10^x \times y \) for some integer \( x >=2 \).
   - For example:
     - \( 10^5 \) becomes 100000, but Dmitry wrote it as 105.
     - \( 10^19 \) becomes a large number, but Dmitry wrote it as 1019.

2. **What Dmitry Wrote**:
   - Instead of the correct number, Dmitry writes down something like "105" or "1019".
   - We need to figure out which integers could have been the result of this kind of mistake.

### How to Approach the Solution:

We know that Dmitry could only have miswritten the number for exponents \( x >= 2 \). For practical purposes, based on the constraints, we focus on a few specific patterns:
- For \( x = 2 \): The numbers will have the form `100 + y` where \( y \) is a number between 2 and 9 (i.e., 102, 103, ..., 109).
- For \( x = 3 \): The numbers will have the form `1000 + y` where \( y \) is a number between 10 and 99 (i.e., 1010, 1011, ..., 1099).

The solution precomputes all these numbers in an array `imp[]`, marking them as possible miswritings of the important number. 


This approach uses precomputation to mark all possible miswritten numbers and then simply checks for each test case if the number exists in this precomputed list.
