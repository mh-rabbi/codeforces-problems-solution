# Simple Palindrome Problem Explanation
<h3> Problem Analysis </h3>
Palindrome Definition: A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. Every individual character is trivially a palindrome. Any string that doesn't have many repeated characters will likely minimize palindromic subsequences.

Subsequence Definition: A subsequence is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string while maintaining the order of the remaining characters.

Objective: We need to generate strings of length n using only vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in such a way that the number of palindromic subsequences is minimized.

<h3>Key Insight</h3>
Non-repeating characters: If a string has repeated characters, it increases the number of palindromic subsequences, because each instance of the character can be part of different subsequences that form palindromes.<br>
Even distribution: Distributing characters uniformly reduces repetition, thus minimizing palindromes.
<h3>Logic</h3>
We will:<br>
Distribute the characters from "aeiou" as evenly as possible across the string of length n.<br>
If n is not divisible by 5 (since there are 5 vowels), we append extra characters until the length of the string reaches n.<br>
<h3>Code Walkthrough</h3>

Function solve()
Input: We read the integer n, which is the length of the string we need to generate.

String of vowels: We define a string c = "aeiou" containing the 5 vowels.

Building the result string:

We initialize an empty string s to store the result.
We loop over the 5 vowels, and for each vowel:
Even Distribution: The character is added n/5 times (i.e., the quotient of n divided by 5).
Remaining characters: If there are leftover positions (n%5), the first few characters from the string c are added again.
Print the result: After constructing the string s, we print it.

<h3> Example </h3>
Test Case 3 (n = 6):<br>

Distribute the vowels:<br>
n/5 = 1, so we add each vowel once. Then, we need 1 extra vowel, so we take one more vowel from the start of the list: "aaeiou".

<br>
This approach ensures minimal repetition of vowels, thus minimizing the number of palindrome subsequences.
